1- Create and enviroment with python

$ python3 -m venv ~/env

$ source ~/env/bin//activate

# to deactivate
$ deactivate


2- create a file called requirements.txt
to install all dependencies of your project

after install from the file, make sure youre on
your python enviroment and continue in this enviroment
till new advise
 
 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt


3- Create a DJango app

 stil in the python enviroment run the follow
 command to automatically create a project folder
 the name for this is "profiles_project" and will be
 at the root folder "."

 $ django-admin.py startproject profiles_project .

now we need create at app into our project for our
provides API so profiles_project can consist of
one or more sub applications, 

$  python3 manage.py startapp profiles_api

it create a new sud folder also in the root


4- now enable the api_app with the django project

to do that got to the profiles_project->settings.py
this file contains the setting for out django app
in this file  look for an array called INSTALLED_APPS = []
and set in a new line the api app

    add the follow apps to the  array 
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'profiles_api',


    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'rest_framework',
        'rest_framework.authtoken',
        'profiles_api',
    ]



5- test the changes we did using django development server

    $ python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000


6- Create user database models
see file models.py and look for  models of UserProfile class


7- add user model manager
see file models.py and look for  models of UserProfileManager class

8- set our custom user model
configure our django project to use this model as default
user model instead of the ones provided for django

set the user model on settings.py at the bottom of the filecreate a new setting

    arguments = name fo the app, name of the model
    AUTH_USER_MODEL= 'profiles_api.UserProfile'

9- create migrations fileand sync DB

every time you change or add a model you need to create a
new migration file

    $ source ~/env/bin/activate
    $ python manage.py makemigrations profiles_api

    it will create a new migration file on migrations/

now run all the migrations of our project
    $ python manage.py migrate
